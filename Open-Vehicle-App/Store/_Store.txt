Product Name:
Open Vehicle Monitoring System


---
Description:
Brought to you by the open-source OVMS project, finally you can remotely monitor your edge cutting EVs. The app shows the current state of charge (SOC), door/trunk/hood status, tire pressures and temperatures (TPMS), core system temperatures (PEM, motor, and ESS/battery), and displays your car's live GPS location on the map.

While OVMS hardware is required to remotely monitor your Tesla Roadster (or other supported vehicles), you can try this app and see what it does via the included DEMO car account.

As this is an open-source project, you can either buy the factory assembled official OVMS car module, or, build yourself one with off the shelf components. Find out more about the OVMS car module (USD99) on our project website: http://www.openvehicles.com/

Open Vehicle Monitoring System

Why?
We are a group of enthusiasts who want an interface to be able to talk to our cars remotely, perhaps add on-car displays (such as heads-up speed), and we want to have fun doing it.

What is it?
The Open Vehicle Monitoring System is three things:
1. A low-cost open-source module that fits in the car (available on the OVMS site). It is powered by the car, talks to the car on the CAN bus, and uses the GSM cellular network to talk to its user.
2. A server (provided by the OVMS project). The car module can be configured to either talk to the server (via UDP/IP or TCP/IP over the Internet) or the user directly (via SMS).
3. A pc/laptop/tablet/mobile App (this app). This talks to the server (via TCP/IP HTTP protocol) to retrieve messages from the car and issue instructions.
